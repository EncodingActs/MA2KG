#### /core_ontologies/hkmalakg
The ontology, devised from MA_ont, is tuned for describing the archival items in the HKMALA.

### Knowledge graph (KG) instantiation

#### /rdf/hkmalakg_wiki.ttl

This file contains the master-centric RDF instantiation for the MA<sup>2</sup>KG, by integrating data from multiple, multilingual sources, e.g., *Wikidata*, *Baidu Baike*, the *Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive*, and manual annotations. Data acquisition was performed based on the **MAont** ontological framework.
